EXAMPLE 1
=========




PIVOT â€“ CROSS LINE
Strategy that works on Pivot Lines
*This strategy is simply a part of the examples that explains how to write strategies.  

If the pivot_point of the Day is not crossed and the price is at a distance of 15 pips  above the pivot_point  we start a session and we sell.
If the pivot_point of the Day is not crossed and the price is at a distance of 15 pips   below the pivot_point  we start a session and we buy.
if the pivot_High of the Day is not crossed and the price is at a distance of 15 pips  below the Pivot_High we start the session and we buy.
if the Pivot_Low of the Day is not crossed and the price is at a distance of 15 pips  above the Pivot_Low we start a session and we sell.
Direction : Forward
Direction Type : Level
PipStep : 15  (distance between trades)
TimeStep : 2 hours (time between trades)
Recovery Mode : K
Recovery Value : 10
Profit : 10 $

(if the trend goes in the opposite direction  an opposite order is performed  at a distance of 15 pips with a size corresponding to the leverage of all my trades to be neutral at a distance of 10 pips of this trade and this is precised in Recovery Value.
